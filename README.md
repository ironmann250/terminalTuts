an amalgamation of clever Technics resulting in a simple step by step coding teacher

# keypoints
-----------
- main program with alternating functions
- efficient looping and memory retention by recursively calling functions
- a database using python dictionaries
- catching system standard input and output
- a minimal modern command line text editor
- making it cross platform with appropriate linux and windows commands
- a continuous loop made with functions
- match answers with regular expression patterns

# running on python 3
---------
- currently only python 3 is supported
- pip3 install py_curses_editor
- python3 main.py

# running on python 2
---------
- few things need to be changed to make it work on python 2
- first change input() to raw_input
- change print() to print
- change from io import StringIO to import StringIO
- change stdout = StringIO() to stdout = StringIO.StringIO() 
- pip install py_curses_editor
- python main.py
